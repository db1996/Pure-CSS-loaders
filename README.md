# Pure-CSS-loaders

A scss project with some pure css loaders and spinners

[Here's the codepen to show them](https://codepen.io/db1996/pen/VrNoBJ)

## Mixins

The dots loader works with a mixin now, i'm still changing everything around and all of them are
going to start working with mixins this way you can have multiple of the same animation with
different settings.
